LinkFinder v0.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------

A zeromq service written in C that will crawl a url 
and return a list of linking urls in json format.

This is an experimental project mostly for
educational purposes.

Please let me know if you find any bugs.  

Cheers


Dependencies needed to compile:

first argument.
